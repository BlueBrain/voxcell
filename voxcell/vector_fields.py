'''library to build, transform and handle fields of vectors and orientations

A vector field is a volumetric dataset that expresses a 3D vector for each voxel.
Vector fields are represented as 4D numpy arrays. The first three dimensions of
the array represent space, the last dimension is always of size 3 and contains the three components
(i, j, k) of the vector for that voxel.


An orientation field is a volumetric dataset that expresses a rotation matrix for each voxel.
Orientation fields are represented as 5D numpy arrays. The first three dimensions of the array
represent space, the fourth and fifth dimensions contain a 3x3 rotation matrix.

Note that although 3D is our main target, most of these functions should behave correctly for lower
and higher dimensionality levels.
